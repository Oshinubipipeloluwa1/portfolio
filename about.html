  <!-- Introduction -->
  <section id="intro">
    <h2>Hello, I’m Oshinubi Pipeloluwa </h2>
    <p>
      I am a Data Analyst based in the United Kingdom and the Founder of Data Delve, an edtech company that supports individuals transitioning into data analytics. My work combines hands-on training, live coaching, and career mentorship to equip learners not only with technical expertise in tools like Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI, but also with the strategies needed to navigate interviews, build portfolios, and thrive in the job market. From structured bootcamps to personalized one-on-one sessions, I guide learners at every step of their data journey.”.

  <!-- Why I Chose Data Analysis -->
  <section id="why-data">
    <h2>Why I Chose Data Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      I’ve always been someone who prefers using my head over my hands. In university, many of my friends were into full-stack web development, and I got pulled in too. I loved the creativity and problem-solving, but over time I realized what truly excited me wasn’t just building something functional—it was understanding the “why” behind it. Why certain choices led to specific results, why users behaved a certain way, and how numbers could tell the story of what was happening.
    </p>
    <p>
      That curiosity led me to invest  in business analysis training. While it helped me see the bigger picture, I still wanted more depth. The turning point came in my own business: profits were dropping, products weren’t selling, and no one could pinpoint the reason. I spent days digging through receipts, spreadsheets, and reports. It was exhausting, yet exhilarating—piecing together the puzzle until it made sense. That’s when I realized data analysis was my calling: problem-solving with meaningful impact.

    <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m fueled by curiosity and the joy of bringing ideas to life—whether solving complex problems at work or refining personal projects. I love turning concepts into reality and believe that meaningful success often comes over the long term. I strive to give my best in everything I commit to while balancing family, personal growth, and well-being.

    <h2>Beyond Work</h2>
    <p>
      Outside of work, you’ll likely find me creating tutorials, running bootcamps, or mentoring aspiring analysts. I’m passionate about helping others understand and harness data to make better decisions. I also enjoy exploring personal projects, learning new skills, and continually pushing myself to grow.
